# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Stop a UTF-8 character inside an OSC, DCS, SOS, PM or APC sequence from
  ending it early. Claude Code sets the window title to "✳ <conversation>"
  when a turn finishes, and the 9C byte of U+2733 was read as a String
  Terminator, printing the rest of the title into the agent pane's input box.

## 0.1.0

Initial versioned release: daemon-owned agent and shell sessions, reconnectable
terminal panes, workspaces and tasks, code review and editing, and SQLite metadata.

- Preserve Shift+Enter as a modified Enter key in embedded terminals.
- Make confirmed reset stop the daemon and clear state in one command, including
  upgrades from daemons without the reset method.
- Add version reporting, macOS/Linux archives, a Homebrew formula, and Windows
  ConPTY/named-pipe support with PowerShell build and installation scripts.
